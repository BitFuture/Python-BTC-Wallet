# Python BTC Wallet
This is a simple bitcoin wallet for the Bitcoin Dublin group:
http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Dublin/

The keygen.py script generates keys and stores saves them to your hard drive. Likewise, wallet.py accesses these so you will need to change the directory for both.

All of the code is written in Python.
